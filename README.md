# What is a blockchain
A blockchain is a public database that is updated and shared across many computers in a network [4].

"Block" refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups known as "blocks". [...] "Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically references its parent. In other words, blocks get chained together [4].

The genesis block is the first block in a blockchain.

Every computer in the network must agree upon each new block and the chain as a whole. These computers are known as "nodes". Nodes ensure everyone interacting with the blockchain has the same data. To accomplish this distributed agreement, blockchains need a consensus mechanism (?) [4].

New blocks are broadcast to the nodes in the network, checked and verified, thus updating the state of the blockchain for everyone [4].

Mining, nonce... (?)

# Blockchain features
- Deterministic: if past transactions could not produce the same result every time they are executed, achieving consensus would be impossible [2]
- Decentralised
- Transparent
- Fast and efficient
- Secure and immutable
- Remove counterparty risk and allow for trust minimised agreements, e.g. insurance company not wanting to execute a payment

- Sharding is a solution to the scalability problem
